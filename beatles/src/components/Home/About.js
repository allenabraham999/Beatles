                Sixty years ago, two young musicians happened upon each other in
                Liverpool, England, in a meeting that would change the course of
                popular music forever. It was July 6, 1957. John Lennon, then
                16, was playing with his skiffle group The Quarrymen at a church
                garden party in the midst of a stultifying heat wave. Paul
                McCartney, 15, was in the crowd, wearing a white sports jacket
                with a pink carnation. In the documentary The Beatles Anthology,
                McCartney remembers the spectacle of Lennon strutting around in
                a checked shirt, "and sort of blondish kind of hair, little bit
                curly, looking pretty cool. And he was playing one
                of these guitars guaranteed not to crack, not a very good one
                but he was making a very good job of it.

                Former Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield compared
                the Beatles to Picasso, as "artists who broke through the
                constraints of their time period to come up with something that
                was unique and original In the form of popular music, no
                one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more
                distinctive ..."The British poet Philip Larkin described their
                work as "an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro
                rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism", and "the
                first advance in popular music since the War".
